                The PowerBook 100 is a portable subnotebook personal computer designed and manufactured by Sony for Apple Computer. Unlike the Mac Portable, which tipped the scales at 15.8 pounds, the PowerBook 100 notebooks weighed just 5.1 pounds. This made them practical in a way the Mac Portable never had been. The PowerBook 100 series proved something of an unexpected hit for Apple, a company burned by its previous attempt at mobile computing.
