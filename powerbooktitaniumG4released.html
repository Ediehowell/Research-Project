            <div class="col-sm-6"><p>Apple produced the titanium PowerBook G4 between 2001 and 2003 and between 2003 and 2006, the aluminum models were produced. Both models were appreciated and credited for their modern design, long battery life, and processing power. When the aluminum PowerBook G4s were first released in January 2003, 12-inch and 17-inch models were introduced first, while the 15-inch model retained the titanium body until September 2003, when a new aluminum 15-inch PowerBook was released.The PowerBook G4 runs on the RISC-based PowerPC G4 processor, designed by the AIM (Apple/IBM/Motorola) development alliance and initially produced by Motorola. After Motorola spun off its semiconductor business under that name in 2004, Freescale rebuilt and redesigned it. The PowerBook G4 has had two different designs: one with a titanium body with a translucent black keyboard and a 15-inch screen; and another in an aluminum body with an aluminum-colored keyboard, in 12-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch sizes. The titanium G4 held many firsts for the Apple company and its computer design. The G4 was one of the first laptops to use a screen with a widescreen aspect ratio while also featuring a front-mounted slot-loading optical drive. Critics began to call the laptop "TiBook", after the titanium case and the PowerBook brand name, just as the ibook that it was sold with. Marketing alongside technology of similar nature has allowed problems to be identified and resolved through comparison processes. Overall, the PowerBook G4 Titanium was well-received for its revolutionary design, powerful performance, and portability. It remains a nostalgic piece of technology for those who used and admired it. </p></div>
