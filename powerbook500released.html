                    <div class="col-sm-6"><p>The PowerBook 500 series (codenamed Blackbird, which it shared with the older Macintosh IIfx) is a range of Apple Macintosh PowerBook portable computers first introduced by Apple Computer with the 540c model on May 16, 1994. It has a sleek black design with a simple black keyboard and trackpad. One of the key features that caused a stir in the computer community was the space left under the keyboard for a more comfortable typing position. It was the first to have stereo speakers, a trackpad, and Ethernet networking built-in. Thanks to many innovative improvements, the 500 series was the first of its kind to use a Motorola 68LC040 CPU (simultaneous with Duo 280) and be upgradeable to the PowerPC architecture via a swap-out CPU daughter card (with the PowerPC and 68040 upgrades for sale), use 9.5-inch Dual Scan passive color/B&W displays, 16-bit stereo sound with stereo speakers, have an expansion bay, PC Card capability, two battery bays (and a ten-minute sleep/clock battery, which allowed for main batteries to be swapped out while in sleep mode), full-size keyboard with F1â€“F12 function keys, be able to sleep while connected to an external monitor and have a battery contact cover included on the actual batteries. Its success may have been most heavily attributed to the improved design of the CPU and PC cards in its design. The 500 series was discontinued completely with the introduction of the ill-fated PowerBook 5300. Despite being discontinued, the Powerbook 500 held many new features that set a standard for future computer design.</p></div>
