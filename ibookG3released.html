            <div class="col-sm-6"><p>Like the iMac, the iBook G3 had a PowerPC G3 CPU, and no legacy Apple interfaces. USB, Ethernet, modem ports and an optical drive were standard. The ports were left uncovered along the left side, as a cover was thought to be fragile and unnecessary with the iBook's new interfaces, which lacked the exposed pins of earlier connectors. Featuring a clamshell design, when the lid was closed, the hinge kept it firmly shut, so there was no need for a latch on the screen. This design was revolutionary and futuristic. People had never seen a computer of this shape and dimension, further intriguing potential customers and computer designers. The incredible and unusual design showed innovators that technology can be created and manipulated into many forms that may appeal to many people. The iBook G3 was more than just its unusual design. It also boasted an optical drive, further emphasizing Apple's commitment to delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly computing experience.  With wireless connecting capabilities, the iBook G3 was a pioneer in the future of wireless technological innovation. This wireless feature made the iBook G3 an appealing choice for users seeking a more flexible and mobile computing experience.
