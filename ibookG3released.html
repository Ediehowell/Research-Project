    <p>Like the iMac, the iBook G3 had a PowerPC G3 CPU, and no legacy Apple interfaces. USB, Ethernet, modem ports and an optical drive were standard. The ports were left uncovered along the left side, as a cover was thought to be fragile and unnecessary with the iBook's new interfaces, which lacked the exposed pins of earlier connectors. Featuring a clamshell design, when the lid was closed, the hinge kept it firmly shut, so there was no need for a latch on the screen. </p>
