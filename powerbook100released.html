        <div class="col-sm-6"><p>The PowerBook 100 is a portable subnotebook personal computer designed and manufactured by Sony for Apple Computer and introduced on October 21, 1991, at the COMDEX computer expo in Las Vegas, Nevada. The computer has undergone many revisions and design processes over the years. After careful evaluations, gears and gadgets have been added to the Powerbook 100 that have become standard for laptops and paved the way for new innovative features to be created and implemented. Priced at US$2,500 with external floppy drive, the PowerBook 100 was the low-end model of the laptops designed by apple. Having a similar design to the Macintosh Portable, it had a Motorola 68000 processor at 16 MHz, 2-8 megabytes (MB) of RAM, a 9-inch (23 cm) monochrome backlit liquid-crystal display (LCD) with 640 × 400 pixel resolution, and the System 7.0.1 operating system. Its CPU and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It did not have a built-in floppy disk drive and was noted for its unique compact design that placed a trackball pointing device in front of the keyboard for ease of use. It has been praised several times for its design; PC World named the PowerBook 100 the tenth-greatest PC of all time in 2006, and US magazine Mobile PC chose the PowerBook 100 as the greatest gadget of all time in 2005. As a pioneer in its design, the Powerbook 100 was closely followed by two other laptops of its nature: the Powebook 140 and the Powerbook 170.</p></div>
